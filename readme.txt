WordPress users deserve a gallery plugin that doesn't frustrate them as they use it - they want a gallery plugin that is actually a joy to use. Other gallery plugins claim to be the best simply because they've been around the longest and have the most downloads. But we know better. MaxGalleria helps change the game by giving users a streamlined experience for creating and managing responsive WordPress galleries that look great on any device.

= The Perfect NextGEN Alternative =

Frustrated with NextGEN and looking for an alternative? You're not alone. MaxGalleria is the perfect choice is it provides a superior user experience for creating and managing your WordPress galleries. We even made it easy to make the switch by providing a simple-to-use NextGEN import tool to move your NextGEN galleries into MaxGalleria galleries.

= Upgrade to the Full Version =

The lite version of MaxGalleria is fully functional and without limitations, but you can take your WordPress galleries further with the [full version of MaxGalleria](http://wordpress.org/plugins/maxgalleria/), which provides all of the above plus much more:

* **Sliders and Carousels** - Create not only image galleries, but sliders and carousels as well.
* **More Image Gallery Templates** - Go beyond the Image Tiles and use additional gallery layouts for your images.
* **Support for Video Galleries** - Create video galleries with their own gallery templates and skins.
* **WordPress Media Library Integration** - Add images to your galleries from the WordPress media library.
* **Custom Styles and Scripts** - Include your own styles and scripts to further customize your galleries.
* **Bulk Edit Functionality** - Edit the details for many images at once, instead of one at a time.

= Compatibility-Friendly =

Another major reason to use MaxGalleria is that it loads its javascript and stylesheet files only on posts/pages where its galleries exist. This also includes within the WordPress admin, thus staying out of the way of other plugins and avoiding potential conflicts.
